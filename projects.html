            <div class="project1" style="padding: 5px;">1) This is a video of an AR drone flying around a classroom. (I would mute this before playing - the drone is pretty loud.) This was part of a group project that I did for my Intro to Network Security class. In addition to this basic controller, which controls yaw, pitch, roll, and allows the drone to land and take off, we also had to come up with attacks on other drones and defenses for our own. It was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed working with my group. (That's me laughing in the background, because it's always amazing when something you build makes something else work.) Note: I have not included a link because this was a group project, and thus the code is not entirely my own work.</div>

            <a class="project">2) This is an application I built after taking several courses in the Android Basics Nanodegree on Udacity. The application takes in team names for a basketball game, and allows the quick and easy counting of points. It also enables the user to restart the counting process, and determines the winner. It's a pretty simple app, but I like it because I took a pretty basic idea that we worked on in class and was able to make it into a really responsive and useful application. (My little brother plays basketball and they never keep score, but my mom likes to keep score by hand, so I was somewhat thinking of her when I built it.) In the future, I would like to store the team points and final scores in Game objects, and have a second screen with a log of all those Game objects. I'd also like to make an undo button, which I would likely do using a Stack. Further explanation is available on Github, as are other Android applications that I have built.</a>

            <div class="project3">3) This is an encryption project I did for my class on network security. It uses the Diffie-Helman method of creating a key using information sent in the open, and thus that both parties (and any eavesdroppers) know. It also sends a message and authenticates the signature that is attached to that message. This uses a basic messaging application that I set up for the class.
