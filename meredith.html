            <p>My name is Meredith Duflock. I'm a rising junior at Georgetown University majoring in computer science and history with a minor in psychology. I spent my last summer balancing a customer service job with six computer science courses, building Android applications, and designing this website. I've tested multiple apps for Google and have been on the debate team for six years, giving me extensive experience with public speaking, research, and teamwork. This website was built and designed by me as a way of developing my skills at HTML, CSS, and various web development frameworks.</p>
            <p>I'm looking for software engineering internships, preferably in the Bay Area. I'm interested in cybersecurity, because I took a class on Network Security that really emphasized to me how vulnerable our systems are, and in small businesses and non-profits, because I worked at a small non-profit for my internship in the summer of 2016 and really enjoyed the experience. My eventual career aspirations are to be a product manager, because I have a lot of experience managing people and find bringing out the best in others really rewarding. I would love to find a way to exercise my leadership abilities while also remaining involved with technology.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing board games, Pokemon Go, and Clash Royale. I also like volunteering, exercising, crocheting, spending time with my friends and family, and learning about history.</p>
